# A beginner's guide to Big O Notation

Big O can we specifically describes the worst-case scenario, and can be used to describe the execution time required or the space used.

### O(1)
this the algorithim always execute in the same time.

### O(N)
the for loop and the function would return early, but Big O notation will always assume the upper limit where the algorithm will perform the maximum number of iterations.

### O(N²)
when the algorithms involve nested iterations over the data set. Deeper nested iterations will result in O(N³), O(N⁴).

### O(2^N)
calculation of Fibonacci numbers.


# Linked List:

- Linear data structures : there is a sequence and an order to how they are constructed and traversed.

- non-linear data structures : we could traverse the data structure non-sequentially.

Lists for all shapes and sizes

- Singly linked lists.
- doubly linked list.
- circular linked list.
